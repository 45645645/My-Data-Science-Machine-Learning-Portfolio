# 📓 Jupyter Notebooks for Anomaly Detection

This folder will contain the Jupyter notebooks used for:

- Data loading & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization
- Feature engineering
- Training isolation forest / LOF / Z-score models
- Comparing results
- Exporting figures for documentation

## Planned Notebooks

### 1. **AnomalyDetection.ipynb**
Core workflow including:
- Load synthetic or real sensor data  
- Plot time-series  
- Apply Isolation Forest  
- Visualize detected anomalies  
- Save output  

### 2. **LOF_vs_IF_Comparison.ipynb**
Comparison between Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest.

### 3. **Threshold_Statistical_Methods.ipynb**
Baseline approach using Z-score, IQR, or rolling statistics.
