# 📓 Notebooks

This folder will contain Jupyter notebooks for experiments related to spectral graph theory and clustering.

Planned notebooks include:

- `SpectralClustering_Demo.ipynb`  
- `Laplacian_Eigenvalues_Visualization.ipynb`  
- `Fiedler_Vector_Analysis.ipynb`  

These notebooks will demonstrate:

- Graph construction  
- Laplacian computation  
- Eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis  
- Visualization of clusters
