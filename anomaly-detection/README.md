## 🧠 Models Implemented

| Model | Description | Strength |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Isolation Forest | Random partitioning-based anomaly detection | Works well for high-dimensional data |
| Local Outlier Factor | Density-based anomaly score | Good for local irregularities |
| Statistical Z-score | Mean & std deviation thresholding | Transparent & explainable |
