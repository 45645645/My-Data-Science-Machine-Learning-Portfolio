# 📂 Results

This folder stores outputs generated by the anomaly detection scripts:

- `anomaly_detection_result.csv` – model scores & anomaly flags  
- `anomaly_detection_plot.png` – visualization of detected anomalies over time  

Files are generated when running:

```bash
python src/anomaly_detection_synthetic.py
```

These results can be used later in notebooks for further analysis or reporting.
